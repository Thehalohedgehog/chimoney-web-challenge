# chimoney-web-challenge

This repository contains Corey Horsburgh's code for the Chimoney Junior Full stack web Developer challenge

1. This code can be run using NodeJS and the "npm start" command in the terminal in the directory once the files are downloaded

2. The features I implimented were a cart that could locally store info on products, some dummmy products for the cart, showing some basic info on a product, a basic order page, a button to show your current cart and buttons to remove all of a product from your cart.

3. My approach to this app was focusing on the functionality first over how it looked. Because of that (and having to rework some code near the end to better match the requirements) I was not able to polish up the look of the app as much as I would have liked. Honestly the timing of when I recieved this challenge wasn't the greatest as I had a lot on the go that prevented me from giving it the attention I would have liked.

4. To improve the performance of the app I would better make use of the localStorage in more areas, as it is currently a bit buggy due to those changes being implimented late into the process. Some parts just get the info from props or objects stored in the component, when it would probably be better to access the needed info from the localStorage.
